                <br /><br />

                    <li>Ability to load academic content already digitised into the ADRI repository and present it to a world-wide audience</li>

                    <li>Digitizing services for traditional content to allow the research to be loaded into the repository and accessed online</li>

                    <li>Consultancy services on how to digitise and republish academic content on the cyber-space.</li>

                The primary benefit of ADRI's services is to provide easy access to Arabic academic content.
                <br /><br />
                ADRI's goal is to provide extensive cross-national publishing services of Arabic content. This provides a central advantage to subscribers of cost-effective access to multiple academic databases through one subscription.
                <br /><br />
                The ADRI model also facilitates academic collaboration among Arab universities in the Middle East. ADRI also aims to provide an interface for Arabic Academic entities to effectively collaborate in developing sound academic and educational policies on both national and regional stages.
                <br /><br />
                ADRI is a technology start-up, registered with the New Zealand Companies Office in March 2014. ADRI is the first of its kind working across the Middle East.
